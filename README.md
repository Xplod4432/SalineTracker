# Saline Tracking

This code interfaces with a hardware project that I have worked on previously named Automated Hosiptal Bed Management System. This code analyses the decrease of weight with respect to time as measured by the hardware counterpart and sends promts as to increase or decrease the drip rate and send actional data to the databases.
